<h2>Eneabba</h2>
<img src="Eneabba.jfif" alt="Eneabba Mineste">
<p>Before we begin to look at the solutions, our team used the Eneabba Minesite as an example as how we could improve it.<br>
   <br>
    The Eneabba minesite is located in Austrlia WA, the area supports native vegetation known as kwongan
    - the Aboriginal word for low, hard scrub and heathland. 
    Kwongan of the Eneabba region is extremely diverse and includes many species, a large percentage 
    of which are endemic to the region. Lake Logue and Lake Indoon are both located a short drive w
    est of Eneabba, on the other side of the Brand Highway to the town. Lake Logue is a large se
    asonal freshwater lake with an abundance of wildlife and bird life. Lake Indoon is another lar
    ge freshwater late, which is ideal for water skiing, barbecues, picnics and camping.  
    <br>
    Eneabba is frequently one of the hottest and driest parts of WA, with temperatures regularly to
    pping 40 degrees in summer, average rainfall from December to February less than 30 mm
    in total and winds that frequently whip through in the 30-40 km per range. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Impacts in the mine site</h2>
    <p> Mining impacts include among others occupation of land for mining, processing and auxiliary 
        activities, use of large volumes of water mainly for processing of ores, development of infras
        tructure, disposal of waste, in some cases production of acidic leachates as well as generation
        of dust and　noise due to blasting and traﬃc of heavy vehicles. All of these impacts may cause
        health and environmental problems to a number of recipients including humans, surrounding ecosystems and
        social structures. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2> How can this be solved?</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="GetImage(1).png">
    <br>
    <p>While rehabilitating land there are many options, but the most efficient we found was 
        the plantation of heat & smoke resistant seeds. These seeds would have to be native from Australia
        ,but would easily be planted in the rehabilitated land. Once the plants fully grow they will shelter nearby plants and wildlife 
        and the land could be later turned into many things such as a National reserve.
        
        <br>
            <h2> How can we make sure the plants will grow?</h2>
    <br>
    
    <img src="Workforce.jpg" alt="Minesite team">
<br>
        <p>To remotely check the data of the seeds and plant growth we woul
            d hire a team that does a census in small areas of the rehabilitated land. We would obtain the information 
            of the progress by checking the ph level in the selected soil (any num
            ber lower than 6 or higher than 7 means that the soil is suffering from nutrient deficiencies). 
            <br>
            The rehabilitation of plant life in the mined areas require a team of experts related to growth of plan
            t life. Native Aboriginals and Torre's Strait islanders have a rich culture of plan
            t regulation techniques. Therefore, hiring them would be crucial to the effectiveness of protecti
            ng the plant life we want to sustain. These techniques include, controlled plant burnings, 
            fishing and hunting of certain species. </p>
